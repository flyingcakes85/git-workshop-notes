This book was originally a simple text file I wrote for myself when hosting sessions. I kept adding bits and pieces until it grew larger than what I'd personally call "speaker notes". I decided I should share these notes with the attendees. Using Pandoc, I generated a PDF and shared it.

The book still remained closed source though. Very recently, I realised that a book about Git that I wrote, being closed source doesn't make sense. So I rearranged it, and published to GitHub under the MIT license. The repo contains everything you need to generate a PDF on your system.
